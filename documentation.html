    <ul class="content">
        <li>Inventors: Stuart Haber & W. Scott Stornetta</li>
        <li>Distributed immutable ledger, transparent, decentralised, distributed P2P network</li>
        <li>Hashing: SHA256: 64 hexadecimal : 256 bits</li>
        <li>Nonce is a number for which the miners are solving, used as the other components of a block can't be changed</li>
        <li>Target is a number that a block hash must be below for the block to be added, adjusted timely so that the average mining time of block is 10minutes</li>
        <li>Mining : process of validation of information according to specific criteria, prevent double spending</li>
        <li>Byzantine Generals Problem: 2/3rd need to support a decision</li>
        <li>Consensus Protocol: prevents attacks, competing chain problem</li>
        <li>Mines get a reward for each block added and for transaction verification</li>
        <li>Miner are beware as they have to give a lot of computing power(money)</li>
        <li>When a miner adds a block they other nodes first run a long verification algorithm.This verification is a very short time process</li>
        <li>Proof of Work: longer chain persists, better computing power more chance of adding the block</li>
        <li>The removed block from the shorted blockchain is called orphan block and the miner who mined it will not get any reward,so one should wait for another 5 blocks(6 confirmations) to added to verify a transaction </li>
        <li>Needs only 51% majority</li>
        <li>Monetary policy : maintain the supply of currency</li>
        <ul>For bitcoin:
            <li>Invented by: Satoshi nakamoto</li>
            <li>the halving: every four years or when the block number increases by 210,000 the number of new bitcoins added is halved, the supply cap is 21million that of 2140 and new BT=0, i.e. the miners wont get rewards though they would receive the transaction fee</li>
            <li>Block frequency : on an average it will take 10 minutes to create a new block, if blocks are mined faster the target is made more difficult and vice-versa</li>
        </ul>
        <li>CPU&lt;10MH/S, GPU&lt;1GH/s, AISC&gt;1000GH/s</li>
        <li>The larger mining pools in not always the best as the rewards are distributed according to the computational power</li>
        <li>nonce range 32bit: 2^32 ~ 4billion, the number of possible hashes is 16^64 ~ 10^77</li>
        <li>So we add a timestamp(unix time) with it to account for the left hashes</li>
        <li>The nonces are covered in negligible time(compared to 1sec). What to do the remaining time till that timestamp changes i.e. 1 sec passes?</li>
        <li>Mempool: pool of all pending (added to a block) transactions</li>
        <li>The miner removes the least fee transaction from the pool(of highest transaction fee) and add just a bit lower then tries and repeats it</li>
        <li>Current hashing rate is 500 million trillion hashes/sec</li>
        <li>UTXO: unspent transaction output</li>
        <li>The left amount is shown as a back to me transaction</li>
        <li>How to find the balance: discard the used transactions and then add the remaining transactions in which 'me' receives</li>
        <li>We use public key when we need to make a transaction so we give it to the receiver, while bitcoin address is used when we have to receive a transaction</li>
        <li>The signature and public key took 60-65% of the space(ScriptSig) while adding a transaction to a block for verification , so after 2017 this was sent separately(segregated witness), approx size of a block 1MB</li>
        <li>Hierarchically Deterministic wallets: multiple private keys by a master private key</li>
    </ul>
